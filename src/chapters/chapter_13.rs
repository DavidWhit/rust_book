    // *** Capturing the environment with Closures
    // Closures have an additional capability that functions don't have:
    // They can capture their environment and access variables from the scope they are defined in

    let x = 4;
    let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;
    let y = 4;

    assert!(equal_to_x(y));

    // if the above was a function that wouldn't work because the scope is within the func
    // However there is a cost associated with it
    // When a closure captures a value from its environment it uses memory to store the values
    // for use in the closure body because normal functions don't allow this it will never incur
    // this same overhead.

    // closures capture values from their environments in 3 ways that map the the Fn Traits
    // 1. Taking ownership     FnOnce can't take ownership of the same variable more than once
    //                         so it can only be called once.
    // 2. Borrowing mutably    FnMut
    // 3. borrowing immutably  Fn

    // Rust infers based on how the closure uses the values from the environment.
    // All closures
    // implement FnOnce because they can all be called at least once
    // Closures that dont move captured vars also implement FnMut
    // Closures that dont need mutable access to vars also implement Fn

    // IE the equal_to_x closure only needs to read the value of x so only needs the Fn Trait
    // you can however force a closure to take ownership of the values it's using by the
    // move keyword before param list
    // This technique is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread so it's owned
    // by the new thread. More to come in chapter 16

    // Be aware move closures may still implement fn or fnMut even though they capture variables
    // by move. This is because closures are determined by what they do with the values.
    // not how it captures them. Move only specifies the latter.

    /* Most of the time when specifying one of the Fn trait bounds, you can start with Fn and the
    compiler will tell you if you need FnMut or FnOnce based on what happens in the closure body.
