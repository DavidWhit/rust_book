    // as the entire struct is valid.

    // However, it is possible for structs to store refs to data owned by something else but to do so
    // requires use of lifetime

    // of the method. In other words, the following are the same:

    // p1.distance(&p2);
    // (&p1).distance(&p2);

    // methods with more parameters

    let rect1 = Rectangle {

    // like String::from is an associated method
